                        <h2>The Sting</h2>
                        <p>The ultimate con artist movie! Paul Newman is such an incredible actor -- him and Robert Redford make such an iconic duo. It's a very clever plot with charming characters. 10/10 would recommend.</p>

                        <p>No other movie has quite a name to it like Casablanca, and its for a reason. I love the plot of the romance between Rick and Ilsa, but the added historical references certainly make you think. I also think its crazy how I never realized "Rick's American Cafe" is a reference to this movie after living in Ann Arbor for over 2 years. </p>

                        <p>I wasn't sure how much I would like this movie because I thought the Western setting would throw me off, but it absolutely did not. Both Butch and the Sundance Kid had really interesting, clever, and complex characters. I got really fascinated by the fact that Butch would never shoot anyone, yet somehow got away with so much. It's also based off a true story, which is realy cool. </p>

                        <p>This movie left my jaw on the floor. There were MANY unexpected scenes, and the way it all circled back to the first scene had me very impressed. Obviously some very iconic characters, actors, and quotes in this film. I'd honestly love to rewatch it, even though I've heard some people say they think it's unsettling. </p>

                        <p>This is the one movie I probably didn't enjoy as much as the rest, purely because of how unsettling it was (horror movies aren't typically up my alley). However, this movie is very unique in the way it was produced. It had a $60,000 budget and made $248.6 million. You'll noticed how truly terrified the actors were -- it was because they thought the lengend was real. Overall, really impressive and worth the watch, especially if you like horror movies.</p>

                        <h2>Gone With the Wind</h2>]
                        <p> I'm glad I watched this movie because of the name it holds and history it displays, but I likely wouldn't watch it again, at least not anytime soon. For starters the movie was 4 hours long so I watched it over the span of three days. In these older movies, I have become very aware of sexist storylines, specifically in love tropes, like the one between Scarlett and Rhett. Beyond the story of the complex Scarlett O'Hara, this movie says a lot of interesting things about life in the South during the war. </p>

                        <p>I actually watched this movies a long time ago, but I had to include it in the list. I'm definitely due for a rewatch but there's nothing more iconic than watching Rocky climb those stairs as they're playing the Rocky theme song.</p>

                        <p> I also haven't watched this movie in a while, but don't know if I plan to watch it any time soon. It honestly just reminds me of my middle school english teacher Mr. Elliot who would always dress up as Atticus Finch when given the chance. That's really all I have to say about this movies, but I think that's pretty important. </p>

                        <p>Such a cute movie! A very classic enemies to lovers story that everyone should watch. I don't really understand why Kralik played with her for so long after finding out Klara was the penpal (it was maybe just a little bit manipulative), but it made for a good story haha and I have no complaints. Very cute cast as well with a lot of silly plot lines.</p>
