                        <h2>The Sting</h2>
                        <p>Both the Netflix series and the books were transformative for me. The books did get repetitive and I didn't read every single one, but it unlocked my love for historical romance. The series, however, is one of my favorite things to rewatch for the character dynamics and beautiful costume design and soundtracks.</p>

                        <p>No movie has ever made me cry this hard. I watched it in an empty theater in the middle of a Tuesday with my best friend, and we both left that movie sobbing. Every time we started discussing the plot on the car ride home we would start tearing up again. I'd recommend for anyone who has any type of maternal issues...</p>

                        <p>For some reason, I was so jealous of the kids who got to be in the cast because they were my age and all seemed like a close group of friends after filming together. It seemed like a dream to have a job that looked this fun. The movie had a good balance of humor and fear, and the characters in the movie were so funny that it made you forget you were watching a horror movie sometimes.</p>

                        <p>The cast was full of amazing (and very attractive) actors and actresses, and it was such a moving story. It should come to no surprise that I cried over this movie as well. I also love a good historical time setting, so this is a movie that I highly recommend for fans of book to movie adaptations.</p>

                        <p>This is the one movie I probably didn't enjoy as much as the rest, purely because of how unsettling it was (horror movies aren't typically up my alley). However, this movie is very unique in the way it was produced. It had a $60,000 budget and made $248.6 million. You'll noticed how truly terrified the actors were -- it was because they thought the lengend was real. Overall, really impressive and worth the watch, especially if you like horror movies.</p>

                        <p>Such a cute movie! A very classic enemies to lovers story that everyone should watch. I don't really understand why Kralik played with her for so long after finding out Klara was the penpal (it was maybe just a little bit manipulative), but it made for a good story haha and I have no complaints. Very cute cast as well with a lot of silly plot lines.</p>
